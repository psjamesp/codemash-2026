## 🎬 Final Note

**The goal isn't to make PowerShell experts in 4 hours.**  
**The goal is to make people who are no longer afraid to try.**

Students should leave with:
- Confidence to open PowerShell
- At least ONE working script they can use
- Knowledge of where to get help
- Understanding that it's OK to Google things

Good luck with your workshop! 🚀
